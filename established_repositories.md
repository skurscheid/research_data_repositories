| :-------------------------- | :-----------------------------------: | :--------- | --------------------------------------------------: |
| ArrayExpress                | <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/> | ArrayExpress Archive of Functional Genomics Data stores data from high-throughput functional genomics experiments, and provides these data for reuse to the research community. | !["ArrayExpress"](images/arrayexpress.png?raw=true) |
| GeneExpressionOmnibus - GEO |  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/>  | GEO is a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. Array- and sequence-based data are accepted. Tools are provided to help users query and download experiments and curated gene expression profiles. |                   !["GEO"](images/geo.png?raw=true) |
| ShortReadArchive - SRA      |  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/>  | Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data, available through multiple cloud providers and NCBI servers, is the largest publicly available repository of high throughput sequencing data. The archive accepts data from all branches of life as well as metagenomic and environmental surveys. SRA stores raw sequencing data and alignment information to enhance reproducibility and facilitate new discoveries through data analysis. |                   !["SRA"](images/sra.png?raw=true) |
| MGnify - EBI | <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/> | MGnify offers an automated pipeline for the analysis and archiving of microbiome data to help determine the taxonomic diversity and functional & metabolic potential of environmental samples. Users can submit their own data for analysis or freely browse all of the analysed public datasets held within the repository. In addition, users can request analysis of any appropriate dataset within the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). User-submitted or ENA-derived datasets can also be assembled on request, prior to analysis. | !["MGnify"](images/magnify.png) |
