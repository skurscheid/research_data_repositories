| ArrayExpress                | <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/> | ArrayExpress Archive of Functional Genomics Data stores data from high-throughput functional genomics experiments, and provides these data for reuse to the research community. | !["ArrayExpress"](images/arrayexpress.png?raw=true) |
| GeneExpressionOmnibus - GEO |  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/>  | GEO is a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. Array- and sequence-based data are accepted. Tools are provided to help users query and download experiments and curated gene expression profiles. |                   !["GEO"](images/geo.png?raw=true) |
| ShortReadArchive - SRA      |  <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/>  | Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data, available through multiple cloud providers and NCBI servers, is the largest publicly available repository of high throughput sequencing data. The archive accepts data from all branches of life as well as metagenomic and environmental surveys. SRA stores raw sequencing data and alignment information to enhance reproducibility and facilitate new discoveries through data analysis. |                   !["SRA"](images/sra.png?raw=true) |
